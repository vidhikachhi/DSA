ðŸ§© DSA Practice Solutions

This repository contains my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions, organized category-wise for easy navigation.
The goal is to create a growing collection of solved problems that can help others prepare for coding interviews and strengthen problem-solving skills.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each folder represents a DSA topic and contains Java solutions to related problems:

Array â€” Searching, sorting, subarrays, etc.
Stack â€” Implementation, evaluation problems, etc.
Queue â€” Circular queues, deque, priority queue problems.
LinkedList â€” Singly, doubly, and circular linked list problems.
Recursion â€” Backtracking, divide and conquer, etc.
DivideAndConquer â€” Merge sort, quick sort, and other techniques.

ðŸ”„ More coming soonâ€¦ (Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Greedy, etc.)

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m still actively adding more problems as I continue my DSA journey. Stay tuned for updates!
